Height of a Binary Tree in C

This repository contains a C program to calculate the height of a binary tree using a recursive approach.

📌 Description

The height of a binary tree is the number of edges on the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.
This program dynamically creates a binary tree and computes its height using recursion.

⚠️ In this implementation, the height of an empty tree is defined as -1, meaning height is measured in terms of edges, not nodes.

🧠 How the Program Works

A binary tree node is created using dynamic memory allocation.

The tree is built manually in main().

The height() function:

Recursively computes the height of left and right subtrees

Returns the maximum of the two plus one

The final height is printed.
